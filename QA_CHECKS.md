## QA Checks

- Player works and stays visually on top; header sits directly below (no overlap).
- Header/nav visible; links navigate to legacy sections.
- Sections (`cta`, `counts`, `our-values`, `clients`, `services`, `pricing`, `team`, `testimonials`, `faq`, `contact`) render with dark/glass style.
- Equalizer moves naturally when playing; idle when paused.
- No layout shifts on load; CSS critical inline reduces flash.
- Lighthouse mobile targets: Performance/Best/SEO â‰¥ 95 (optimize images as needed).
